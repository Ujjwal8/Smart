1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:14,880
III 2017 an absolute perfect event now

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,449
normally I don't care about III I've

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,510
been let down too many times too many

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,390
times have I watched this shit and I get

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,900
so hyped for a game and and then it just

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,660
kills it I worry about like

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:35,430
disappointing people you know did the

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:40,350
game just crash the ps4 it is completely

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,090
crashed sorted I found that it's so much

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,660
more satisfying to be pleasantly

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,420
surprised by a game rather than just

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,809
bitterly disappointed hype is dangerous

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,969
hyper kills good games if you see a

14
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,390
cinematic trailer and you think all that

15
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,910
game looks cool you better run run real

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:11,540
fast cuz most likely the game will be

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:11,540
shit wow wow wow wow

18
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:21,799
but now I've learned to appreciate III

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,759
for a different reason the cringe

20
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:36,829
compilation and God thank you thank you

21
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:40,459

22
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:48,610
really good it was it was spectacular

23
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:51,890
but it got better as time went oh oh yes

24
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,679
god bless you god bless see now don't

25
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,079
get me wrong I think it's cool that AEA

26
00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:00,560
brings in influencers to promote games

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,469
but isn't Jesse a prank channel dude I

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
don't know whatever like I don't care

29
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:07,009

polygon with the first to point out to

65
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:04,000
attack influencers as they do they keep

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,480
attacking good people like myself with

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,910
these what what what wow disgusting

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,530
claims games or companies can't ignore

69
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,940
YouTube or the hope of reaching a

70
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,290
broader audience but if you don't

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,690
understand what the talent they're

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,310
paying can and can't do well and plan

73
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,989
accordingly it's going to be awkward

74
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,590
well god damn it that actually makes

75
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:28,150
sense polygon god damnit this doesn't

76
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,660
set my narrative damn you polygons I was

77
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,780
expecting you to write a bunch of shit

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,490
they give influence of swag bags

79
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,560

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,470
games is a wonderful thing alright let's

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:55,840

85
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:58,450
try to collect some of my favorite we

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,810
just disabled a moving truck with a

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:08,640
grenade while jumping off a horse

88
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:12,870
incredible that is incredible incredible

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,970
I feel bad I think that's the reason the

90
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,350
compassion is a important element of a

91
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,840
cringe I hope you guys don't think I'm

92
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,670
just judging all these people feel for

93
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,920
these people I bleed for these people

94
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,070
because I am these people but ten times

95
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,380
worse incredible it hurts it really

96
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,970
hurts to see this I just wish no one was

97
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,840
socially awkward and we could all just

98
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,790
live our life normally but in reality

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,630
interacting with other people it's too

100
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,290
high

101
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,770

and the whole world will see that oh

106
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,450

212
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,870
main reason that turns me off is the

00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:50,660
hype but also the way they look at you

214
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,450
as a consumer it feel so off how they

215
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,370
