00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,360
hi I'm Sal Khan founder of the

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,299
not-for-profit Khan Academy and I have

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,219
some very exciting news the data is in

4
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:15,289
from our first year of the partnership

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,090
between us and the College Board around

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,910
Khan Academy being the official practice

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,039
for the SAT and what we're seeing is

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,289
students who spend an average of 20

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,410
hours of practice on Khan Academy are

10
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:31,070
seeing roughly a hundred fifteen point

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,990
gain between the PSAT and the SAT and to

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,850
put that into perspective that's roughly

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,640
twice the point gain that students

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,100
typically see between the PSAT and the

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,809
SAT and what's especially heartening is

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,920
that we're seeing that game be

17
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:48,649
consistent across gender race and

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,750
socio-economic groups and so this makes

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,039
us feel really good not just from the

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,050
Khan Academy's point of view or the

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,329
College Board's point of view but just

22
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,640
in the overall theme of being able to

23
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,920
help level the playing field students

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
take the PSAT they can sync those

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,699
accounts with the Khan Academy Khan

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,830
Academy software then has the

27
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,870
information necessary to essentially do

28
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,760
a weak point training know where you

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,860
need practice not just in math but in

30
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,930
reading and writing as well and you get

31
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,030
that practice so that you can put your

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,460
best foot forward not just on the SAT

33
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,790
but to be optimally prepared for college

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,490
and for life so this is exciting news

35
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,830
it's also just the beginning and we hope

36
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,290
to work with all of you students parents

37
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:34,570
teachers to further level the playing

38
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,570
field for college and life access
