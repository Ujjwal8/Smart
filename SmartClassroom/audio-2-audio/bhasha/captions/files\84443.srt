1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,290
Most of us don't think much
about the ocean's tides.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,610
Tide goes in, tide goes out.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,150
It's just some water moving

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,740
because the moon and sun are pulling on it.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,799
But those words: "just some water" hide an
incredible amount of matter,

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,010
and "pulling on it" hides an
unimaginable amount of force.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,449
And nowhere is that more obvious
than right here.

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,039
I'm just north of the Arctic Circle in Norway,

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,660
half an hour's drive from a town called BodÃ¸.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,359
The land here is mostly what Douglas Adams
called 'lovely crinkly edges':

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,809
and this particular lovely crinkly edge
holds the Saltstraumen Maelstrom:

12
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,440
the most powerful tidal current on the planet.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,070
And the reason it's so powerful:

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,949
that way is the sea.

15
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,320
That way is a fjord, a tidal inlet.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,340
Twice a day here, the sea rises and falls
by about two metres,

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,329
so the water level in the fjord tries to equalise.

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,730
The catch is that pretty much all the water
it needs to do that,

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,860
400 million cubic metres give or take,

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,500
has to go through this channel.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,859
There are other routes that it could take,

22
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,610
but the land masses make those slow and shallow.

23
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,780
They're winding country roads

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,650
whereas this is like a twelve-lane freeway.

25
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,590
It's... well, it's a perfect storm.

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,670
There's a huge mass of water on both sides
providing pressure,

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,540
and the channel starts wide and
steadily narrows to the centre both ways.

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,400
It's the right width, and the right shape,

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,360
to create this maelstrom of whirlpools and
currents and vortices.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,140
What surprised me the most, coming here and
standing next to it,

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,190
is how much it changes, moment to moment,
second to second,

32
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,899
every little twist in the tide and the water

33
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:35,790
creates a new vortex and a new boil.

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,360
I had to get close enough to
stick my camera in on a long pole,

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,670
and honestly?

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,579
It terrified me.

37
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,070
Tour groups can take an inflatable boat
out into the channel,

38
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,250
and you'll see occasional fishing vessels
taking advantage

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,720
of all the marine life
that gets shunted through here.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,270
But unlike the whirpools of myth and legend,
this maelstrom

41
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,840
isn't going to pull a modern, bouyant,
powered boat down to the depths,

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,340
although a swimmer on their own would be in
a lot of trouble,

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,440
and a large ship might lose control and be
dashed against the rocks.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,740
But all this force, all this water,

45
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,790
this is just a fraction of
what's being pulled around

46
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,630
out on the ocean.

47
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,350
It's just here it's visible,
it's on a human scale, it's threatening,

48
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,920
so here we pay attention to it.
